####Come up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %>% count(dest) and not_cancelled %>% count(tailnum, wt = distance) (without using count()).

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
View(flights)
not_cancelled <- flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

```

not_cancelled <- flights %>% filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
