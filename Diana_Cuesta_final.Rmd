###Exercise 1 - Sampling Distributions, Functions and For Loops (10 points)
The exponential distribution has a rate parameter that controls how quickly the distribution decays and defines what the mean and standard deviation will be. In our case the rate = 1/10000, the mean = 10000 and the  standard deviation = 10000. You can sample from this exponential distribution in R using this code:
