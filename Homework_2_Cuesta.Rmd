```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)

```

How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?
234 rows, 11 columns

What does the drv variable describe? Read the help for ?mpg to find out.
f = front-wheel drive, r = rear wheel drive, 4 = 4wd

Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cyl, color = class))
```

What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = class, y = cyl, shape = class))
```
